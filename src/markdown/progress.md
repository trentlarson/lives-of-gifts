## Some Notes On Money

When it comes to finances, we hope to make enough to support these efforts in
perpetuity but there is no goal to make profit. (We are part of the non-profit
[Bridge Foundation](https://bridgefoundation.community/), a 501(c)(3) charitable
organization.) So there are a couple of principles that we'll abide:

* Any service or product offered for trade will be clearly defined and separated
  organizationally. The core services will always be gifts to the world, and will
  hopefully get to the point where individuals and communities can run their own
  infrastructure in a way that integrates seamlessly and contributes to the
  worldwide effort. We plan for this effort to grow with more and more input into
  local support and less and less input into a single, central organization.

* If we pay salaries, the highest compensation will not exceed 5X the lowest.
  The ultimate structure would be that we provide basic livelihoods for many people
  and our support would come from donations out of the extra resources from that
  pool, given totally voluntarily.
