What would you like help with, or how can you help in other projects? Let's get
better at coordination: advertise anything you want done, or pledge help to
others. Propose any conditions for your help... maybe it's only worthwhile if
half-a-dozen more people join or if someone commits to a certain amount of time.
Kids are especially good at getting participation, and we can encourage even
more growth when they learn to better communicate and solicit help with their
interests. Use [Time Safari](https://timesafari.org) to share
[projects](/projects) using [common data
schemas](https://endorser.ch/doc/html/transactions.html).

We're also creating project [visualizations](https://observablehq.com/d/83a90a6d6cd11999).
